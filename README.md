# Matrix Calculator
This is a dimensionable square matrix calculator, which has the basic operations addition, subtraction and multiplication, and shows the process of each operation.

### Funcionality
For data entry you can do it through the above boxes [Press Enter] (On the right it shows in which index of the matrix you enter the data.) or directly from the matrix boxes.

In addition to being able to operate on whole numbers you can operate on fractions separated by the slash symbol "/".

The matrix calculator also has validations in both forms of data entry, for example: empty boxes, text and symbols. (It will make an exception for the symbol that divides the fraction).

Pdt: The matrix calculator is basic, In the future with more knowledge of the language, I plan to increase functionality and better optimize the code by following good practices and writing clean code.
